Your client has a severe performance problem in a heavily loaded EJB application as a consequence the system doesn't scale up properly in the peak traffic period during the Xmas shopping rush days. So he hired you to hunt for the possible performance bottle nicks and come up with possible solutions. The application is deployed as one EAR in one JVM and the data base is running on a separate machine. The session beans are only accessed by the web application deployed in the same EAR file. ( Select one),Change all local session beans to remote session beans
